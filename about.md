Hi there! You can call me Aki. 👋 I'm currently preparing for backend job applications, mainly focusing on Java. 💼<br>
I'm a front-end and game development enthusiast. In front-end development, I specialize in React, Next.js, and Three.js. 💻 
I also love participating in GameJams and have created game demos using Blender and Unity. 🎮 <br>
I'm also a big fan of anime! Recently, I've been watching Bocchi the Rock! 🎸 It's the most fun anime I've watched this year. If you get the chance, you definitely have to check it out! 🎉 <br>
It's my pleasure to meet you here! 🥳
